CSE 403 Team Status Report, Week 2
4/4/2018

Progress we’ve made this week

* We made a GitHub repo for our chosen project.
* We made a Google Drive share for our reports.
* We discussed some potential directions in which we can take our project. (We have the general 
  idea established, but we need to form a more concrete goal. There is still a little ambiguity about 
  how we will organize and test alternative implementations.)

Goals for next week

* We want to solidify the details about our tool’s proposed functionality (all responsible).
* Once we have a good understanding of our tool’s proposed functionality, we want to create
  a timeline of work to do to create it (all responsible).
* We should do some research about Java testing to determine what resources are available 
  to us as we set about creating our tool (all responsible).
* Depending on how far we get, in the next week we may be able to split up the work and each 
  start working on individual aspects of the code (all responsible).
