CSE 403 Individual Status Report, Week 3
4/9/18

Progress I've made this week:

This past week, I mainly focused on helping my teammates edit and refine our project proposal. While we have made 
more progress regarding how we might best go about this, it seems our motivation still needs some work. We still 
lack examples of concrete use case examples that demonstrate how SAIT would be helpful in the programming world.

Plans and goals for this week:

Seeing as there are some concerns from the staff about our approach, my main goal is to help my teammates address 
those concerns and solidify the motivation behind what we are doing. I would like to explore alternatives to 
incorporating our tool with JUnit, to see if any of them would be more compatible with our functionality. I would 
also like to come up with some concrete use case examples for SAIT that clearly show the motivation behind it.

Once we have addressed these concerns, my goal is to collaborate with my teammates to finalize the specifications
of our design. If we make good progress on that this week, I may even be able to start writing some preliminary 
tests for our code.
